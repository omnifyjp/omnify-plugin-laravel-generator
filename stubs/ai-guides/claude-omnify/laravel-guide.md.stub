- Auto-generated from schema changes
- Handles column additions, modifications, removals
- Preserves manual migrations outside omnify folder

### Models
Two-tier model structure:
- `app/Models/OmnifyBase/*BaseModel.php` - Auto-generated, DO NOT EDIT

- Generated once, safe to customize
- Uses appropriate Faker methods for each type

## Model Features

```yaml
password:
  type: Password
  hidden: true
```

- `ManyToOne` → `belongsTo()`
- `OneToMany` → `hasMany()`
